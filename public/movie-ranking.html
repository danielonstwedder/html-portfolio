<h3>2. Star Wars - Revenge Of the Sith</h3>
<p>
   Unbelievably good. Contains everything you would want for a movie, cool action fight scenes, high intensity, incredible musical score, drama, emotions. All round fantastic
   <br>
   8.9/10
</p>
<h3>3. Inception</h3>
<p>
   Very good movie. The storyline behind it is incredible that you are just sat in amazement afterwards and in awe. I remember not knowing what to think of reality after finishing it. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat and just when you think you understand what's going on, a new twist enters.
