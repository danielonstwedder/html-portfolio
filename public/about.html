<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a work driven, detail oriented, motivated and determined first year student studying Computer Science at Queen's University Belfast. I am a skilled Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript coder. My ambition is to work as a Cybersecurity analyst</p>

<p>I have experience working in multiple projects within university such as designing a Restaurant Recipe System in Java, designing a Carnival Shooter Game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and creating a database for an employment agency in MySQL. I am able to work efficiently in a team, assigning and receiving various responsibilities. I am an efficient, hard working and ambitious student.</p>

<p>I have plenty of experience working in teams such as in Rugby where I have captained and led my team, in Flag Football I lead the defensive side as well as playing in the national setup for Ireland. This has provided me with the ability to work in an environemnet with high demand, expectancy and pressure whilst still being able to perform to the highest standard. As a musician skilled in Clarinet, Saxophone and self taught in Piano and Guitar, I have gained the ability to be creative, to flow from others ideas and to create my own melodic ideas.
